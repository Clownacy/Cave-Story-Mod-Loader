My first module for this, adds the
 <MBX TSC command, which shows a Windows message box.

This serves as an example for stackable hooks.

While the command defaults to MBX, this can be changed,
 along with the caption, in the settings.ini file.

Usage:
<MBXYou only get one shot, Clownacy.;

Should appear along the lines of:

 +-Information----------------------+
 | You only get one shot, Clownacy. |
 |                            <OK>  |
 +----------------------------------+
